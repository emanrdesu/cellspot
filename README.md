This is my first "real" website, made for my cuban friend who's business is selling phones imported from the USA.

Stack wise, here's what I used:
- *Frontend:* Svelte 
- *Backend:* SvelteKit
- *Database:* Prisma ORM + MySQL
- *Host*: Vercel

I learned alot with this project, but I'm going to take it to the next level by using more libraries to be able to do more.
